          Diamond jewellery may be durable, but it is not indestructible. Gold can scratch, delicate structures can
          bend, and diamond settings can loosen when exposed to repeated impact.
        </p>
        <p>For everyday protection:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Put your jewellery on after applying makeup, perfume, lotion, and hairspray.</li>
          <li>Remove jewellery before bathing, swimming, exercising, or sleeping.</li>
          <li>Avoid wearing jewellery while cooking, cleaning, gardening, or doing heavy work.</li>
          <li>Keep jewellery away from chlorine, bleach, detergents, sanitiser, and harsh chemicals.</li>
          <li>Do not pull chains, pendants, bracelets, or earrings forcefully.</li>
          <li>Avoid dropping jewellery onto hard surfaces.</li>

        <p>Everyday exposure to natural skin oils, soap, lotion, and dust can reduce a diamond’s sparkle.</p>
        <p>For gentle home cleaning:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Fill a small bowl with lukewarm water.</li>
          <li>Add a few drops of mild liquid soap.</li>
